      </h3>
      <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-3">From my previous assignment, AI is the most
fascinating part of IT that I would like to figure out. My project is going to
be about generating a system with AI integration of using drones to clean
windows on skyscrapers. Along with this system, there is a program that will
calculate the size of the windows and estimate how many drones does it take to
execute the work. AI, as well as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL),
will be applied to the program to ensure the work is optimized. The system will
be installed for pilots on some of the buildings located in the city center in
Ho Chi Minh City. To be honest, my expectation for this project is really large
because it can replace human to clean windows on skyscrapers, thus, abrupt
risks would be avoided.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                  </h3>
                  <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">Buildings
that are higher than 50 stories appeared more and more in recent years in Ho
Chi Minh City. For instance, Landmark 81 opened in 2018 with a total height from
the bottom to top is more than 450 meters has become the highest building in
Vietnam (Viet Vision Travel, 2018). However, if sanitation workers would like
to clean the windows of this skyscraper, it would be a massive challenge for
them, especially people that are afraid of height. The purpose of creating a system
of drones to scrub the building from the outside is an answer to this problem.
The drones will replace workers to do this dangerous task, moreover, all the
tasks will be done automatically.</p>

                          <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">The
system for running this service will be known as “Sky Smart Cleaning” or S.S.M.
There are many teams with up to 3 drones to do different tasks separately such
as flushing, scrubbing, and drying. The reason why the systems need several
teams to execute the work is to make sure that the progress will be done on
time. Furthermore, workers can always have preventive drones to replace if some
of them face technical difficulties. The number of drones could be up to 100 at
the same time when operating, which means that the area which needs to be
cleaned might be nearly 10000 square meters. It takes 10 minutes for a team to
clean with a space of 100 square meters, when we put it into comparison, it is
faster many times than cleaning by hand. In addition, the drones can implement
the work with skyscrapers which have a sophisticated design. There are 3 types
of drones that used, the first one is flushing, this drone has a container that
holds water and cleaning fluid. The next is scrubbing, this drone will be
equipped with brushes that have a speed of spin at 1000 rounds per minute. The
last one is drying, there are two turbines as same as the jet engine are
mounted under the drone to create a strong flow of air to dry the windows.
Nevertheless, depending on the building, drones that can do two tasks at the
same time will be used more favorably to decrease the operating fee although
its performance is lower than the one that only does one task separately.</p>
                          <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-3">The
stages to clean a skyscraper will not be too difficult with the assistant of
these drones. First, the owner must send the specifications of the building to
the sanitation company within 2 weeks so that engineers can prepare in advance.
Second, all the specifications will be put into the program to run the drones,
computer will estimate the amount of water, cleaning
fluid that is used for cleaning depends on the area the owner want to wipe,
the computer also suggests the number of drones to do the work efficiently.
Third, the cleaning task would be begun at that building, many groups of drones
will be deployed at the same time. The flushing drone will discharge a mixture
of water and cleaning fluid with high pressure to the windows, after that, the
scrubbing drone will undertake its task, finally, the drone with turbines will
dry all the remaining water on the windows. However, if the entire building is
not be constructed of glass, AI on the censor of the drone will detect and
automatically move the drone to an area that has glass. The work will be
carried out from the highest to the lowest level of the building, the work
progress will be updated continuously by the AI for engineers and workers. In
addition, AI can use the information from the weather to determine a suitable
date for cleaning. After finished cleaning, all the data of the process will be
stored on Microsoft Azure in order to analyze and reuse for the next time. If
the skyscraper does not need to be cleaned entirely, engineers just need to
adjust a few necessary metrics according to the customer.</p>

project will be an enormous change for the windows cleaning job. First, instead
of spending more than 3 months to clean the outside of a skyscraper, the drones
just only need less than 5 hours to complete it. Second, the owner of the
building can save a large amount of money using for cleaning the window, the
money can be saved up to $5000. Finally, it will be the safest and fastest
solution for this job when people do not have to work at a very high place and
dangerous. Moreover, throughout this project, I can improve my knowledge as
well as skills for developing AI a lot, it will be an impressive experience for
me as a software engineer.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-4">Both
of them are interested in my idea. They said that the drones could help a lot
of workers that cleaning windows of high buildings, in addition, it can reduce
the number of accidents related to window cleaning on skyscrapers. They were
impressed about how AI had been applied to drones so it would operate smarter.</p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-5">However,
there are some problems which I have received in the feedback. The first person
is Khanh, he said that all the feature should have been combined together but
still keeping the performance or higher. He wants it to reduce more money
because the fee to deploy all the drones is too expensive so it must decrease
the number of drones. In my opinion, this is a good idea because I can save a
lot of money but I think it is difficult to put all the features in the drone.
Some problems may incur due to the problem of an electrical circuit in the
drone. As a result, it can make the drone explodes or falls during the process.</p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-6">The next person is Nguyen, who was worried about the accuracy of data of
the weather that the drone use, there is no guarantee of full adaptability to
unpredictable weather conditions like storms, lightning, heavy sky projectiles
like rain droplets or hails. Obviously, I have prepared for this situation, all
the drone will have the ability of water-resistant, it allows the drone to
withstand water for 30 minutes, in that time, engineers can access the drone
through the laptop and order it to quit the task and land. He also mentioned
the ethics of automation, workers would lose their jobs due to these drones,
these people subsist on low wages and brave dangers to clean windows on
skyscrapers. He recommended me to use AR technologies to enable the workers to
control the drones from afar, moreover, opening training sessions and workshops
on how to operate and maintain the drones will be the best solution to keep
their jobs and improve the quality of their work. I think the way of using AR
is really interesting, as a consequence, I will open a workshop for the workers
to train them for operating the drone with AR, this will create a new job for
them and they can have a higher salary.</p>
