            </h3>
            <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">In
my project, AI will be applied to support engineers and workers in their jobs.
The reason AI is used because it will help them to save a lot of time to
execute simple tasks. In recent years, artificial intelligence has been mentioned
more than before, for instance, all new smartphones released are announced that
all have AI integrated on it. Developers know that when they use the “AI” word,
more customers will notice their products and willing to spend money on their
products. Why do more and more people dedicate their attention to AI?</p>
            <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-3">Artificial
intelligence (AI) can be described as a machine that is worked by facsimileing
human intelligence. AI has some same characteristics as human-like thinking and
problem–solving (Investopedia, 2020). The advantage of AI that it can do
everything faster than us. For example, we need to spend at least many hours to
figure out a complex calculation, however, AI can do it within 10 to 15
minutes. This example demonstrates that its potential is remarkably great if we
put it into human life.</p>
            <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-4">The
origin of AI began at Dartmouth College in 1956 when John McCarthy invented the
phrase “Artificial intelligence” for the first time (Livescience, 2014). Nevertheless,
human-faced numerous difficulties to research AI in the 1970s, at that time, the
government claimed that the amount of money spent on AI projects was too
costly. As a result, they suspended sponsorship movements for AI of many
associations. Today, many large tech companies expend a lot of money to study
and develop AI, especially in the Industrial Revolution 4.0, a robot is using
more in plenty of fields, work is gradually automated, and so on.</p>
            <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-5">At
this time, we can find AI anywhere, the easiest example is your smartphones. On
Apple devices, we have Siri, Google Assistant for Android, and Alexa from
Amazon, all of them are virtual assistant that programmed by a human. They are
able to do many things that you never think about, they can control your
lights, air conditioners, and other appliances, just only a Wi–fi connection,
and your home will become smarter. Furthermore, you can ask them about how the
weather is it, where is the nearest supermarket to my house, this is a useful
feature because we do not have to go to the Internet and search for what we
want. To be honest, I love talking to Siri on my phone, I usually order her to
set the alarm, play some music, connect my phone for watching. My experience
with Siri is truly amazing, in addition, I could let her do some stuff that I
used to do it before.</p>
            <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-6">In
the next three years, AI might be more intelligent, it will improve the quality
of our life as well as safety, health, labor productivity. Along with
artificial intelligence, we cannot ignore machine learning – an important
factor that contributes to the success of AI. With ML, a computer can solve
problems which more sophisticated for humans and give the result with high
accuracy. For example, self – driving cars can predict the condition of the
traffic jam and find another way to exit. This is a good solution to reduce traffic
congestion during the rush hours, people do not have to spend time on the map
to navigate a good highway back to their home anymore. Moreover, the government
can have support from AI to organize elections, referendum. They also use AI
for analyzing the huge amount of data from the citizens in order to enhance
public services (Ey, 2019).</p>
            <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-7">To
make these things turn into reality, ML needs to be advance more as well as AI.
Human has to find a way to increase the accuracy of the result that the computer
gives. With self – driving cars, the sensor can be improved more to detect not
only cars, people but also the quality of road surface, warning about bad
weather. For the government, they can use face scan or iris recognition for
their citizens, with this technology, AI will detect them much faster and
safer.</p>

              <br>
            </h3>
            <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">At
present, AI has had a significant impact on our daily life, however, it might
be much more developed than now, at the time, not only in our daily life but
also in any field. People will have the support of AI in the military, space
and so on, besides, the work efficiency will be increased forcefully along with
intensifying the number of tasks that humans do (Bernardmarr, 2020). Moreover,
AI can also undertake repetitious or dangerous instead of us, as a consequence,
we will have more time to do the work which offers creativity and long – term
research.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-3">Because
AI, as well as robots, can replace us in numerous fields, there will be an
unemployment crisis, many people will lose their jobs. The most severely
affected people will be workers, farmers, officers. They have to find other
jobs to cover not only their life but also families. The good news is if AI
replaces the existing jobs, more new jobs will be created. The only difficulty
is new jobs are required higher qualification, to find the solution, the government
should enact policies to advance the qualification of laborers.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-4">The
development of AI will create many jobs related to programming and data. People
who are interested in machine learning will have an opportunity to approach
this sector, furthermore, many companies will also make recruitment for this
position. For instance, menial jobs such as porters, the geological survey will
be replaced by robots, humans do not need to execute these tasks anymore. As a
result, health will be protected, the harsh work environment has been assumed
by AI and robots. In conclusion, mankind will make a giant leap with the
development of AI, many goals that have not achieved by the previous generation
now can be resolved by us and AI.</p>

            </h3>
            <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">In
daily life, AI brings a lot of advantages for me. It can help me reduce time to
research information for studying at university, this can be defined as when I
search for something on the Internet, the computer will remember and give me
the suggestion of related content for the next time I search. I do not need to
set an alarm before going to bed anymore, the only that I have to do is ask
Siri to do it for me, the other thing that when my hands were dirty,
undoubtedly, I could not touch my phone so I ask Siri again to change the music
that I was listening to. It also happens when I am playing video games, in the
past, I chose the hardest level to have the best experience. However, after
several times playing, I remembered the mechanism of it and I can win the game
easily. Today, my experience is more different a lot than before, not only do I
remember its mechanism but also the computer learn my style that I play to find
a way to defeat me. The game that I talk about is FIFA 21, the machine learning
in this game is truly amazing, I have to change my tactics after several
matches because AI can expect the style which I going to play.</p>
            <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-3">AI
has a great impact on my family additionally. For instance, my dad had to
vacuum the entire house every week many years ago, until I ordered a robotic
vacuum cleaner for him, he is free up to relax because now the robot will clean
all the areas in my house. Moreover, it can do every day so that my house is
even cleaner than before. For my mom, she usually asks Siri to find some
recipes or videos that teach cooking, she can do it even when cooking, it is
terrifically convenient. In the future, I think there will be a robot that is
able to execute all the housework so that my parents can spend more time
relaxing.</p>
