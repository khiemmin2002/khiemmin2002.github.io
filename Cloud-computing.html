            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-palette-2-dark-2 u-text-2">The
factor which contributes to the development of AI is data. AI has to handle a
large amount of data, it can be up to millions of gigabytes, the question is
how can human store these data in a computer. That is the reason for the release
of cloud computing where people can store all the data on it. Cloud computing
can be seen as a second brain of Internet devices, in addition, it is helping
many giant tech companies to actualize their largest ambition. Cloud computing
can be defined as the way of providing computing services such as servers,
storage, databases, networking, software, and so on based on the Internet
(Microsoft Azure). To understand easily, instead of installing these services
on your local computer, it will be located on virtual servers on the Internet
so that you can use them anytime and anywhere.</p>
            <p class="u-text u-text-palette-2-dark-2 u-text-3">When
World Wide Web (WWW) was invented in 1990 along with the first web browser in
1993, it has laid the foundation for the development of cloud computing after.
Professor Ramnath Chellappa - Associate Dean and Academic Director of the
Master of Science in Business Analytics program of Emory University has
clarified the term “Cloud Computing” in 1997 as follows: “Computing paradigm
where the boundaries of computing will be determined by economic rationale
rather than technical limits alone.” (Cloud Tweaks). In 1999, Salesforce.com
had become the pioneer in providing enterprise-grade apps on cloud server
through the Internet, users can access these apps when they have the Internet,
enterprises can buy savings services according to their necessity additionally.</p>
            <p class="u-text u-text-palette-2-dark-2 u-text-4">Today,
Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox is part of cloud computing. Users can store their
documents, photos, videos on that without worry about their computer capacity.
Human is using cloud computing for many other purposes such as software
development and testing, big data analytics (AWS). For instance, companies use
cloud services instead of buying or maintaining hundred of computers and
software, as a result, they can focus more on the objectives for the benefit of
the company because the infrastructure and technology have been undertaken by
others. Another example is the gaming industry, developers make use of the
power from cloud computing to distribute online servers to all gamers around
the world. Imagine that 100 million people are playing League of Legends at the
same time on a normal server, without a doubt, they never can access the game
because the server is not programmed to supply the resource for the number of
people like that.</p>
            <p class="u-text u-text-palette-2-dark-2 u-text-5">In
the next three years, cloud comp​uting will appear more in our daily life. It
can be used for complex purposes such as user information management, business
management, operating artificial intelligence. For example, Huawei will release
Industry Cloud where thousand of separate clouds can operate concurrently on a
digital ecosystem of different industrial segments. They expect that 85 % of
enterprise applications will be set up on the cloud. As a consequence,
operators will have an opportunity to deliver services for these enterprises to
gain profit (Huawei).</p>
            <p class="u-text u-text-palette-2-dark-2 u-text-6">At
the moment, Huawei is still studying Industry Cloud, if they want it to become
real, they need to ensure its quality. First, the most important thing is data
security, the reason why I mention data security because Huawei is still having
difficulties in protecting its user's information. Second, they should have
better infrastructure to develop this cloud, as we know, the Trade War with the
USA has had a great impact on Huawei, it will be a challenge for them to find a
partner for research together. Finally, Huawei needs to reconsider the
compatibility of Industry Cloud, enterprises will use it and they cannot avoid
problems during the process of using or they cannot execute the tasks.</p>

            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-palette-2-dark-2 u-text-2">In
the future, cloud computing will be implemented more in our daily life. First,
it will make an impact on education, students do not need to bring many things
to school such as notebooks, books, they can replace them with a laptop or an
iPad, in addition, they can push their homework on the cloud so that they do
not need to worry about the homework will be lost anymore (Built In, 2019).
Second, people can work remotely from home, especially in a pandemic, a Wi – fi
connection with a laptop can allow employees to finish their work without
coming to the workplaces, all their tasks will be executed on a cloud. Finally,
developing countries should apply cloud computing in the telecom industry
because resources are always available on it so that they do not need to invest
a large amount of money for building the infrastructure traditionally (IBM,
2013).</p>
            <p class="u-text u-text-palette-2-dark-2 u-text-3">Many
people expect that cloud computing will shape the future life of mankind, it
will be the basis for issuing digital infrastructure in order to serve modern
cities in the future. For instance, elevators, smart parking, flying as well as
self – driving car will be operated by computers, all of them will be improved
about the safety and manageability thanks to large storage capacity with speed
analysis of cloud computing. With cloud computing, numerous jobs will be
created, people will have more choices to find their suitable career. As a
result, not only fabricating a revolution for our future and Internet but also
generating many opportunities in finding new jobs, we can see how great is it
of cloud can do for us. Cloud computing will be an indispensable part of the
future of human society.</p>

            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-palette-2-dark-2 u-text-2">Cloud
is really convenient in my daily life; I use a lot of services from the cloud
because the advantage is undeniable. For instance, iCloud is a service that I
use to back up the data on my phone, it helped me to transfer my documents,
photos from iPhone to iPad easily. I do not need to plug it into the computer
before, the only that I must have is an Internet connection. The most
fascinating that I am going to talk about is Google Home – a speaker that can
control my entire house. It has AI integrated so it will be more intelligent
and can communicate through Google Assistant. With Google, I do not have to
touch anything, I will use my voice to ask them to turn on the lights, air
conditioner, or play some music. Furthermore, I can continue to watch my video
on YouTube on the TV when I ask Google to do it for me.</p>
            <p class="u-text u-text-palette-2-dark-2 u-text-3">For
my mom, she loves the synchronization feature of iCloud because she can see
every photo from her phone on the iPad. Besides, she can save many cooking
recipes on it and never worry about it could be lost. At my university, my
friends prefer to use Google Doc instead of Microsoft Word because it allows us
to type, edit the document together, which means that many people can access it
at the same time, we can give comments for the idea, as a consequence, my
friend can modify it immediately. We also use Google Drive to save all the
homework and studying materials because it can be protected better and we do
not have to put everything in a bag and bring it to school every day. The
benefits are it can reduce a lot of time, just open the app and find it to use,
the other that we can use the materials anywhere, it is more convenient than
finding a good place at a coffee or library to do the homework.</p>
